# Rock-a-Tac
Rock-a-Tac is a simple board game that combines two classic time wasters into one great app, tic-tac-toe and rock-paper-scissors. 

## How to play:

The object of the game is to get three in a row using one each of your pieces (Rock, Paper & Scissors).

Once you've started a game, to switch the game pieces when it's your turn, just tap on the podium on the right. That will make it cycle through Rock, Paper & Scissors.

Once the tic-tac-toe game board is filled up (normally a stalemate), you may continue playing by taking over an opponent's spot with a game piece of yours that beats the opponent's piece. So if the opponent has a rock in the center spot, you could take that spot over with a Paper since that beats Rock.
